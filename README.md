# Minecraft-Test-Mod-Fire-Sword
This is my first mod for minecraft. 
It is a fire sword item. 
Currently it is a plain item with a custom sword texture. 
Sword attributes and a fire effect still need to be added.

In the future I would like to learn how to create my own block in minecraft and continue learning.
